## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* Docker and Docker Compose installed.
* (Optional: Node.js and npm/yarn for local frontend development)
* (Optional: Python and pip/conda for local backend development)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone [repository URL]
    cd StaySmart
    ```

2.  **Build and run the Docker containers:**

    ```bash
    docker-compose up --build
    ```

    This command will build the Docker images and start the frontend and backend containers.

3.  **Access the application:**

    Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` (or the port specified in your `docker-compose.yml` file).

### Local Development (Optional)

If you prefer to develop the frontend and backend separately:

1.  **Frontend:**

    ```bash
    cd frontend
    npm install # or yarn install
    npm start # or yarn start
    ```

    The frontend will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

2.  **Backend:**

    ```bash
    cd backend
    pip install -r requirements.txt # or conda install --file requirements.txt
    python app.py # or similar, depending on your backend setup
    ```

    The backend will be available at `http://localhost:5000` (or the port specified in your backend code).

    **Note:** When developing locally, you may need to adjust the API endpoints in your frontend to point to the local backend.

### Docker Compose Details

The `docker-compose.yml` file defines the services for the frontend and backend. It also handles networking and volume mounting.
